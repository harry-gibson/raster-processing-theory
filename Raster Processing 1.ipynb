    "Fundamentally a CPU - the brain of the computer - just does arithmetic with numbers - that's all. Any time a computer is doing anything more than this, there's just layers upon layers of abstraction turning what you see / do into basic sums.\n",

    "So it's really beneficial to know a bit about how computers work, because it's helpful to get a feeling for:\n",
    "- whether something is as fast as it could be: is this piece of work always going to be slow, or is my code just not very fast?\n",
    "- if not then where the easy wins might be to make it better\n",
